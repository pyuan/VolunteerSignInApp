Sign-In
==================

Sign-In is a simple registration app made for non-profits to eaisly allow their participants (usually volunteers) to access a waiver/disclaimer and provide their signatures, which can then be composed and sent as a PDF through email for safe keeping. The app is made using the latest iOS 8 SDK written in Swift and was inspired by my experience leading the Uptown Tech Club for Chicago Cares.
